Allows users to adjust the brightness and contrast of images, enhancing the visibility of specific structures.

Brightness Adjustment: Modifies the overall lightness or darkness of the image. Increasing brightness can reveal details in darker areas, while decreasing it can reduce glare in overly bright images.

Contrast Adjustment: Alters the difference in luminance or color that makes an object distinguishable. Increasing contrast can help differentiate between similar shades, enhancing the visibility of specific structures.
