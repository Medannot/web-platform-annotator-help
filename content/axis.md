Axis Tab

The Advanced Axis Tool, accessible directly from the toolbar, provides a sophisticated means of manipulating the viewing and orientation axis based on both predefined axis settings and dynamic input from the current mouse position. This dual-functionality approach allows for an intuitive and highly responsive interaction with 3D models or complex images, making it an essential feature for detailed analysis, precise modeling, and interactive exploration.
