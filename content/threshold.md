Threshold

"Threshold" is a powerful tool at your disposal, especially useful when you're dealing with images where you need to distinguish structures based on their smoothness or intensity. It's like setting a marker—anything above, below, or outside certain values can be highlighted or ignored, depending on what you're looking for.

The histogram will show you a graphical representation of how pixel intensities are distributed. Peaks in the histogram indicate a high frequency of pixels with those intensity values, often corresponding to specific structures in medical images or other detailed visuals.

1. Find the holders on the histogram’s x-axis. 

2. Make precise adjustments:
   Use the upper drag holder for fine-tuning the threshold or specific pixel intensities. Drag left or right to adjust precisely without overcompensating.

3. Make broad adjustments:
   Use the lower drag holder for significant changes to brightness or contrast. This holder compresses or expands the histogram for quick, substantial adjustments.

4. Apply the adjustments:
   Release the holder and immediately review the changes on a real-time preview, if available. Make further adjustments as needed.

5. Finalize changes:
   Confirm the adjustments by clicking “Apply” to save the settings.
   Or disable the changes by clicking "Cancel". 

Predefined values for structures you’re interested in will usually manifest as distinct peaks within the histogram. These peaks help you identify the intensity ranges that are most relevant to the structures you want to segment.
