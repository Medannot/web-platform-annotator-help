Threshold

"Threshold" is a powerful tool at your disposal, especially useful when you're dealing with images where you need to distinguish structures based on their smoothness or intensity. It's like setting a marker—anything above, below, or outside certain values can be highlighted or ignored, depending on what you're looking for.

The histogram will show you a graphical representation of how pixel intensities are distributed. Peaks in the histogram indicate a high frequency of pixels with those intensity values, often corresponding to specific structures in medical images or other detailed visuals.

Predefined values for structures you’re interested in will usually manifest as distinct peaks within the histogram. These peaks help you identify the intensity ranges that are most relevant to the structures you want to segment.!
