Fill

The "Fill" function is designed to streamline the segmentation process across multiple slices within a dataset. It allows you to create complete segmentations on selected slices using any available editing tool and then automatically fills the gaps between these segmented slices. This is achieved through interpolation, ensuring a continuous and consistent segmentation across the entire volume, even if some slices are skipped.
